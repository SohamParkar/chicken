Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken. Once the chicken is partially cooked, itâ€™s important to layer it with the fried onions, mint and coriander. The onions add sweetness and richness while the herbs add a ton of flavor. This is then layered with rice and then topped finally with soaked saffron and ghee.
